# CHANGELOG

## 0.6.0 (9/11/15)

* Allow quantization > 100% for overlapping notes. ([crisptrutski])

## 0.5.3 (9/10/15)

Exit with error code 1 when parsing fails for `alda play` and `alda parse` tasks. ([MadcapJake])

## 0.5.2 (9/9/15)

* Bugfix: add any pre-buffer time to the synchronous wait time -- keeps scores from ending prematurely when using the `alda play` task.
* Grammar improvement: explicit `octave-set`, `octave-up` and `octave-down` tokens instead of one catch-all `octave-change` token. ([crisptrutski][crisptrutski])

## 0.5.1 (9/8/15)

* Pretty-print the results of the `alda parse` task.

## 0.5.0 (9/7/15)

* New Alda REPL commands:
